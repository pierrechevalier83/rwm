rwm - rustic window manager
---------------------------

rwm aims for the same goals as dwm:
It should be a fully featured tiling windows manager that sucks less.

In addition, it should
- use wayland rather than X
- be written in rust

That way not only will it suck less, but it will do so using tools from our decade :)

This is a WIP. I may not go far or do much with this project. Time will tell.
